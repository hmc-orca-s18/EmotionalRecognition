# Emotional Recognition

Real Time Recs will recommend Spotify playlists for users based on their mood. The application will allow the user to upload a selfie, and then using that image, a Machine Learning Model will categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). Once the emotion is determined, the application will use the Spotify API to recommend music playlists to match that mood.
